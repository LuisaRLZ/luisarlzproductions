Watch the video above starting from minute 1:23 for fast instructions in most Tweaks Installing!

Before installing any tweak, make sure to create a backup of your files, just in case anything goes wrong!  

If something does go wrong, just put the backed files back or run Version Check from launcher  

Almost every tweak / mod in this page is installed the same way: Download File by clicking any Download 
Button, then Uncompress the files and put them directly into your Server's client folder.

-- Tip 1: If you don't know where your Server's Client Folder is, just right-click the icon that launches the 
game, then select "Go to file location".

-- Tip 2: If you can't uncompress the files, you may be missing an uncompressor software. Download one of the 
following (they're free) and you'll be able to open the files.

Download WinRar: https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0
Download WinZip: https://www.winzip.com/en/download/winzip/
Download 7-zip: https://www.7-zip.org/

-- Tip 3: The tweak is nice, but you feel you could make a better version? find more interesting information
