So this is a file that is supossed to work exactly as the typical Animation Tweak
while also showcasing some very short animations.

To install, place the scripts folder into your game client.

This tweak is meant to be as fast as the normal tweak while also providing
some "life" to the game.

Flash Bomb delay fixed within this version.

This version contains ALL MONSTERS in-game (vanilla monsters).

To add this tweak to servers which have custom monsters:
- Open your server's CharacterAction.tx file at scripts/table
- Copy all 1 to 4 (lance to ami) animation sets from this tweak
- Paste them into their respective places in the original server file and save
- Enjoy and send me a beer

~*~ All movements can be further edited. I added notes to the file
so you can see which lines you have to edit ~*~

This tweak tries to follow what "natural" movements would be on *my* opinion
however, some melee functions might look a bit clunky as
I couldn't find any decent short-span animations for them
I might update this if further versions are created.
Also, I left crusader animations from a known old tweak intact here.
Credits to it's original creator (I got it from Hollister myself)

Lastly, as usual, you know I love being credited but you may edit
and share your very own editions of this tweak.
